# Mission-to-Mars
## Background
Robin, who hopes to be noticed by NASA created a web app that functions well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate the  four hemisphere images.

## Analysis

        -Save the Full Size image URL and Title for each of the 4 hemispheres into a list. 
        
        
    2. Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
       -Add code to scrape new data that pulls the full images of the hemispheres and displays to web app.
